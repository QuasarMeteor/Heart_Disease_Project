# Heart_Disease_Project
This data comes from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, and the analysis is done in R.

Business Scenario:
    You are a health care data scientist who has been tasked with identifying the important factors that may 
    affect the presence of heart disease. You have been given a data set from a few years ago, and your boss
    wants to know if we can somehow predict heart disease from the data we have available. 


GOAL(s):
  * Perform data cleaning
  * Explore the differences between iterative regression versus mean imputation values
  * Perform exploratory data analysis
  * Create a machine learning models that can predict if a person has a heart disease


This binary prediction looks into Logisitic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine models.
